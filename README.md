Sure! Below is a fictional resume for a Python library that serves as a client for the EnergyStar API.

---

**Library Name:** `energystar-python-client`

---

### **Summary**
`energystar-python-client` is a robust Python library designed to facilitate seamless interaction with the EnergyStar API. It enables developers to easily access, manage, and integrate energy performance data into their applications. The library abstracts the complexities of API requests and responses, providing a user-friendly interface for fetching and manipulating data related to energy efficiency and environmental metrics.

### **Features**
- **API Integration:** Full support for EnergyStar API endpoints, including querying for building performance data, certification statuses, and energy efficiency metrics.
- **Authentication:** Secure OAuth2.0 authentication to safely access user-specific data.
- **Data Parsing:** Built-in methods to parse and normalize JSON responses into Python objects for easier manipulation.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms for robust application development.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implements automatic rate limiting to adhere to API usage policies.
- **Data Caching:** Optional local caching of API responses to reduce redundant API calls and improve performance.
- **Extensible:** Easily extendable to add new endpoints or customize existing ones to suit specific needs.

### **Requirements**
- **Python Versions:** 3.7+
- **Dependencies:**
  - `requests`
  - `requests-oauthlib`
  - `pandas` (optional, for data manipulation)
  - `cachetools` (optional, for caching)
  
### **Installation**
Install the library via pip:
```bash
pip install energystar-python-client
```

### **Usage Example**
```python
from energystar import EnergyStarClient

# Initialize the client with OAuth2 credentials
client = EnergyStarClient(client_id='your-client-id', client_secret='your-client-secret', token_url='your-token-url')

# Fetch energy performance data for a specific building
building_data = client.get_building_data(building_id='12345')

# Display the fetched data
print(building_data)
```

### **Documentation**
Comprehensive documentation is available on [ReadTheDocs](#) or within the libraryâ€™s GitHub repository, covering setup, usage, and examples for each API endpoint.

### **Contributing**
The project is open-source and welcomes contributions. Issues can be reported on the GitHub repository, and contributions can be made via pull requests. See the contributing guidelines for more details.

### **License**
`energystar-python-client` is released under the MIT License.
