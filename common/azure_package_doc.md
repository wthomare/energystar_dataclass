# Azure Functions Repository Documentation

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Repository Name
**[Your Repository Name]**

### 1.2 Purpose
Provide a brief description of the repository and its purpose. Explain what the Azure Functions in this repository do, and any relevant business or technical context.

Example:
> This repository contains Azure Functions used for processing various data pipelines, including message handling from Azure Service Bus, blob storage operations, and scheduled data clean-up tasks.

### 1.3 Key Features
- **Function Types**: Describe the different types of functions (e.g., HTTP, Timer, Service Bus, Event Hub).
- **Technology Stack**: Azure Functions, C#/Python/JavaScript (whichever language you are using), Azure Storage, Azure Service Bus, Azure SQL Database, etc.

## 2. Repository Structure

Provide an overview of the repository structure, describing the folders, files, and their purposes.

Example:
```
azure-functions-repo/
│
├── .github/                   # GitHub configuration files for workflows
├── FunctionApp1/               # First Function App
│   ├── Function1/              # First Azure Function
│   ├── Function2/              # Second Azure Function
│   └── host.json               # Configuration file for function app settings
│
├── FunctionApp2/               # Second Function App
│   ├── Function1/              # First Azure Function in second app
│   └── host.json               # Configuration file for function app settings
│
├── tests/                      # Unit and integration tests
├── .gitignore                  # Gitignore file
├── LICENSE                     # License information
├── README.md                   # Main documentation
└── requirements.txt / .csproj  # Dependency file (Python or .NET)
```

## 3. Prerequisites

### 3.1 Tools
List the tools and software required to work with the repository.

Example:
- **Azure CLI**: For managing Azure resources.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Recommended IDE for development.
- **Azure Functions Core Tools**: For running and debugging functions locally.
- **Node.js / Python / .NET SDK**: Depending on the language of the Azure Functions.

### 3.2 Azure Subscription
You need an active **Azure subscription** to deploy and test these functions.

## 4. Setup

### 4.1 Cloning the Repository
To clone the repository locally, run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/azure-functions-repo.git
cd azure-functions-repo
```

### 4.2 Local Development

#### 4.2.1 Installing Dependencies
Depending on the language, install the required dependencies.

For Python:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For .NET:
```bash
dotnet restore
```

#### 4.2.2 Running Functions Locally
Use the Azure Functions Core Tools to run the functions locally.

```bash
# Start the Azure Functions runtime
func start
```

You can test the functions locally using tools like **Postman** for HTTP triggers or **Azure Storage Explorer** for queue triggers.

### 4.3 Application Settings
Create a local `local.settings.json` file to store application settings such as connection strings. This file should not be committed to source control.

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet"
  }
}
```

### 4.4 Running Tests
To run the unit tests, execute the following command based on the test framework.

For Python:
```bash
pytest
```

For .NET:
```bash
dotnet test
```

## 5. Deployment

### 5.1 Deploying to Azure
You can deploy the functions using the Azure CLI, GitHub Actions, or CI/CD pipelines.

#### 5.1.1 Azure CLI Deployment
```bash
# Log in to Azure
az login

# Create a resource group
az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location westeurope

# Create a function app
az functionapp create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --consumption-plan-location westeurope --runtime dotnet --functions-version 4 --name MyFunctionApp --storage-account mystorageaccount

# Deploy the function
func azure functionapp publish MyFunctionApp
```

#### 5.1.2 Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
You can set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps. Below is an example GitHub Actions workflow for deploying the Azure Functions:

```yaml
name: Azure Functions CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
        with:
          dotnet-version: '6.x'

      - name: Build project
        run: dotnet build --configuration Release

      - name: Deploy to Azure
        uses: Azure/functions-action@v1
        with:
          app-name: 'MyFunctionApp'
          package: '.'
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
```

### 5.2 Configuration on Azure
Explain how to set up necessary configuration on the Azure portal, such as environment variables, scaling, and logging settings.

Example:
> - **Scaling**: Use the **consumption plan** for automatic scaling based on incoming requests or events.
> - **App Settings**: Define settings like `AzureWebJobsStorage`, `ServiceBusConnection`, etc., in the Azure Function App Configuration section.

## 6. Contribution Guidelines

### 6.1 How to Contribute
Describe the steps contributors should follow to submit changes to the repository.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes.
4. Run tests locally.
5. Submit a pull request.

### 6.2 Code Standards
Outline the coding standards and best practices contributors should follow.

- Use consistent naming conventions.
- Write unit tests for new functionality.
- Follow best practices for Azure Functions, such as using dependency injection where possible.

### 6.3 Branching Strategy
Describe the branching strategy for the repository (e.g., Gitflow, feature branches).

Example:
> - **main**: The main branch contains production-ready code.
> - **develop**: This branch is used for active development and testing.
> - **feature/**: Create feature branches for new functionality.

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

### 7.1 Application Insights
The Azure Functions are integrated with **Application Insights** for monitoring and logging. You can track exceptions, request performance, and custom logs in the Azure Portal under the Application Insights section.

### 7.2 Debugging and Troubleshooting
For local debugging, use the built-in debugging tools in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. Logs can be viewed in the Azure Portal or streamed locally using `func logs`.

## 8. Licensing

Include the license for the repository. For example:
> This repository is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more information.
