Creating documentation for an Azure Function involves several sections that provide a comprehensive overview of the function, its purpose, configuration, usage, and deployment. Below is a template for the documentation:

---

# Azure Function Documentation

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Function Name
**[Your Function Name]**

### 1.2 Purpose
A brief description of what the Azure Function does. Include the problem it solves or the business need it addresses.

Example:
> This Azure Function processes incoming messages from an Azure Service Bus queue and stores them in an Azure SQL Database.

## 2. Function Details

### 2.1 Trigger
**Trigger Type**: [e.g., HTTP Trigger, Timer Trigger, Service Bus Trigger]  
**Trigger Details**: Provide specifics about the trigger, such as schedule for a timer, HTTP endpoints, etc.

Example:
> **Trigger Type**: Service Bus Trigger  
> **Queue Name**: `myqueue`

### 2.2 Input Bindings
Describe any input bindings used by the function.

Example:
> **Input Binding**: Azure Blob Storage  
> **Blob Container**: `input-container`  
> **Blob Path**: `input/{name}`

### 2.3 Output Bindings
Describe any output bindings used by the function.

Example:
> **Output Binding**: Azure SQL Database  
> **Table Name**: `ProcessedMessages`

### 2.4 Environment Variables
List any environment variables or application settings that the function relies on.

Example:
> - `AzureWebJobsStorage`: Connection string for the Azure Storage account.
> - `ServiceBusConnection`: Connection string for the Service Bus.
> - `SQLConnectionString`: Connection string for the Azure SQL Database.

### 2.5 Dependencies
List any external dependencies, such as NuGet packages, third-party libraries, or other services.

Example:
> - **Newtonsoft.Json**: Used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
> - **Dapper**: Used for interacting with the Azure SQL Database.

## 3. Deployment

### 3.1 Prerequisites
- **Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have an active Azure subscription.
- **Azure Resource Group**: The resource group where the function app will be deployed.

### 3.2 Deployment Methods
Describe the different methods to deploy the function, such as through Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or CI/CD pipelines.

#### 3.2.1 Azure Portal
1. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Create a new Function App.
3. Deploy the function by uploading the code or using continuous deployment from a source control repository.

#### 3.2.2 Azure CLI
Provide the Azure CLI commands for deployment.

Example:
```bash
# Log in to Azure
az login

# Create a resource group
az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location westeurope

# Create a function app
az functionapp create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --consumption-plan-location westeurope --runtime dotnet --functions-version 3 --name MyFunctionApp --storage-account mystorageaccount

# Deploy the function
func azure functionapp publish MyFunctionApp
```

#### 3.2.3 CI/CD Pipeline
Outline the steps for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or another platform.

Example:
1. Set up a build pipeline to compile the function code.
2. Configure a release pipeline to deploy the function to Azure.
3. Include stages for testing and approval if necessary.

## 4. Usage

### 4.1 Triggering the Function
Explain how to trigger the function, including example HTTP requests or event payloads.

Example:
```bash
# Trigger using HTTP
curl -X POST "https://myfunctionapp.azurewebsites.net/api/myfunction" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"value"}'
```

### 4.2 Expected Input
Describe the expected input format, including any required fields or headers.

Example:
> **Expected Input**: JSON object with the following structure:
> ```json
> {
>   "messageId": "string",
>   "payload": "string"
> }
> ```

### 4.3 Output
Describe the output produced by the function, if any.

Example:
> The function returns a JSON response with a status code and message:
> ```json
> {
>   "status": "success",
>   "message": "Data processed successfully"
> }
> ```

## 5. Monitoring and Logging

### 5.1 Application Insights
Explain how to configure and use Application Insights for monitoring and logging.

Example:
> The function is configured to use Application Insights. Logs, exceptions, and performance metrics can be viewed in the Azure Portal under the "Application Insights" section of the function app.

### 5.2 Troubleshooting
Provide tips for troubleshooting common issues.

Example:
> - **Error**: "Function runtime is unable to start"
>   - **Solution**: Check the application settings and ensure all required environment variables are set.

## 6. Maintenance

### 6.1 Updates
Outline the process for updating the function, including version control and deployment strategies.

### 6.2 Scaling
Describe how the function scales and any considerations for scaling.

Example:
> This function app is configured with a consumption plan, which automatically scales out based on the number of incoming events.

## 7. Security

### 7.1 Authentication and Authorization
Explain how the function is secured, including any authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Example:
> The function uses Azure AD for authentication. Access is restricted to specific users and roles.

### 7.2 Data Protection
Describe how sensitive data is handled and protected.

Example:
> Sensitive data such as connection strings are stored in Azure Key Vault and accessed via managed identities.

## 8. Appendix

### 8.1 References
List any references or resources that were useful in developing the function.

### 8.2 Glossary
Define any technical terms or acronyms used in the documentation.
